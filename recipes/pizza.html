    <p>This homemade pizza recipe is perfect for parties! Everyone loves pizza, and your guests can customize their toppings to suit their personal tastes.</p><br>
    
    <h3><b>What to Serve with Homemade Pizza.</b></h3>
    <p>With a good whole grain crust and lots of veggie toppings, homemade pizza is a filling meal on its own. If we want something on the side, though, my first choice is always a seasonal salad. A simple green salad or arugula salad is an easy, fresh option, but if I’m not tossing greens together, I'll often use leftover pizza toppings to make a fun, flavorful side salad.</p>
